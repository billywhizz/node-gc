node-gc
=============

A very small wrapper around v8 Garbage collection. 

To build:

node-waf configure
node-waf build

you should then have a gc.node binary which you will need to make available to any 
scripts that want to use it.

To use in a script:

var gc = require("./gc");

var GC = new gc.GC();
gc.collect();

run test.js for a full example.
